# Hybrid-AR-LSTM-model-for-prediction-of-birth
Although ARIMA, AR essentially for linear update models plus some noise thrown in and LSTM essentially for a nonlinear time series model are well known in the literature we have applied them in the data. Based on the fact that the LSTM outperforms the AR then the AR outperform the ARIMA according to their results, we have came with an idea of combining the two best models AR and LSTM in single architecture that that will take advantage of the two models and capture linear and nonlinear phenomena because it has both linear and nonlinear modeling capabilities.
